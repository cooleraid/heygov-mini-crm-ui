# HeyGov (Frontend)

HeyGov Mini CRM provides an easy way to quickly add contacts & easily manage or find existing ones.

## Assumptions
1. It's assumed that users won't be authenticated to access the CRM.
2. It's assumed that a unique client ID is generated and stored in the localstorage to identify different users per device.
3. It's assumed that pagination isn't necessary because it's a demo CRM and the time constraint for the project completion. 

## Requirements
1. Mac OS (feel free to use any OS).
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
3. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) (NPM)
4. [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/).
5. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
